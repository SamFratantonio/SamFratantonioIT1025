# Executive summary
Type your executive summary as if you were explaining your lab on an IT team

# Information System Componentsâ€¯ 

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

Hardware - The physical components that make up the machine. 

Software - Data that acts as a set of instructions allowing a computer (or something like a computer) to work.

Data - Stored information.

People - The people who use and work on the system.

Process - The way the system works and what went into designing it.

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model. 
Client server architecture means that most of the actual software is hosted on a server and the users (clients) interact with it via the internet.
* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?
GitHub is cloud computing because all of the data is on their servers and the users interact with it by going on the website, it's "cloud" computing because it works over the internet. Another example is repl.it

# Conclusion
In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.
