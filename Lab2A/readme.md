# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
  *Latency is the average time it takes for the hard drive to find a certain piece of data that's on it by rotating the disk and the transfer rate is how long it takes to actually   save/copy data from the disk.
* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers 
  *Decimal is in base 10, binary is in base 2 and hexadecimal is in base 16.
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)
* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)
* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)
